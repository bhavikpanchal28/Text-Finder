# Text-Finder
### Bhavik Panchal

This is a small project I completed during my final year User Interfaces course (SOFE 4850U) at Ontario Tech University. \
This is a small search bar that will take the input of the user and find all of the words in the JSON files that begin with the user's input, in other words, finding the user's text. 

To use this project yourself, download all of the files, then open the HTML file while the other files remain in the same directory.
